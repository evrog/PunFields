# PunFields
This is the start of the project for annotating sentences that contain semantic ambiguity, i.e. where a word or phrase is intentionally used in two meanings.
The scientific side of it is described in:

Mikhalkova, Elena, and Yuri Karyakin. "PunFields at SemEval-2017 Task 7: Employing Roget's Thesaurus in Automatic Pun Recognition and Interpretation." Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017). 2017.

This is not a ready-made package, but a number of Python-2.7 files that can be added to your project.
Any help in improving it and making it an installable toolkit is welcome! 

The file 'Roget' was created based on: 
Peter Mark Roget. 2004.  Rogetâ€™s thesaurus of English words and phrases. Project Gutenberg.
