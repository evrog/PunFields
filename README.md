# PunFields
This is a start of the project for annotating sentences that contain semantic ambiguity, i.e. where a word or phrase is intentionally used in two meanings.
The scientific side of it is described in:

  abstract  = {The article describes a model of automatic interpretation of English puns,
	based on Roget{'}s Thesaurus, and its implementation, PunFields. In a pun, the
	algorithm discovers two groups of words that belong to two main semantic
	fields. The fields become a semantic vector based on which an SVM classifier
	learns to recognize puns. A rule-based model is then applied for recognition of
	intentionally ambiguous (target) words and their definitions. In SemEval Task 7
	PunFields shows a considerably good result in pun classification, but requires
	improvement in searching for the target word and its definition.},

This is not a ready-made package, but a number of Python-2.7 files that can be added to your project.
Any help in improving it and making it an installable toolkit is welcome!
